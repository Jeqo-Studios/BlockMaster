# GUI
Handles all the GUI elements including the GUI itself and the items that appear within it. There is
a separate class that is used to retrieve the custom skulls used in the GUI menu as back, next, and
info buttons. This is done to avoid having to create a new skull item each time a new GUI is created and
to increase simplicity across the plugin.
