This subdirectory handles all interaction of players with blocks and GUI elements. This prevents players
from interacting with blocks that they should not be able to interact with. This also handles the GUI
elements that are used to interact with the plugin. This means that when a player clicks a GUI item, the
inventory handler will handle that click even accordingly.
