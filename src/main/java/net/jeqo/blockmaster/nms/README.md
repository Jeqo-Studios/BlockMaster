# NMS
The classes here handle the translations of functionality that is not supported by the Bukkit API. This includes
handling the creation of custom blocks, entities, and other objects that are not supported by the Bukkit API. This
makes it also so that we can handle different functionality differently across different versions of Minecraft.
